I started off this project really wanting to generate everything with jQuery. It didn't work out. I ended up using HTML and some bootstrap elements to make everything look nice. I'm not sure why this seemed so much more difficult than the last project in terms of generating elements. 


## Notes
Difficult to get the navbar and the container to line up on the page correctly. They're stacking on top of each other. I think it's a css problem, mainly because the generated HTML looks the same as my hardcoded html. I might come back to it later. It's nice to have some elements I can work with. 

Now that I have a few of my html elements in there, I want to start dealing with the API.
