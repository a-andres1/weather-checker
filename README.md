## Notes
Difficult to get the navbar and the container to line up on the page correctly. They're stacking on top of each other. I think it's a css problem, mainly because the generated HTML looks the same as my hardcoded html. I might come back to it later. It's nice to have some elements I can work with. 

Now that I have a few of my html elements in there, I want to start dealing with the API.
